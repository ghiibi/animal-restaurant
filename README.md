# Top 5 - Animal Restuarant 
Gabby's top five favorite customers, staff, and recipes from the Animal Restaurant.

## Top Five Customers
_Although there are over 311 customers in Animal Restaurant. Here I only cover the Regulars and Special customers._

### 1. Gnome

![gnome](Gnome.webp "Gnome - Animal Restaurant")

The gnome is rarely seen and can only be attracted by cooking Fried Rice, Takoyaki, Chocolate Cake, Salmon Sushi, or Kimbap. I particularly like this character due to its whimsical design. 

### 2. Granny Wolf

The Granny Wolf is from the town and commonly orders Roast Shrimp, Fried Shrimp Sushi, Espresso, or Steamed Clams. The allusion to Red Riding Hood and red scarf design really pulls together the character. 

### 3. White Shiba

The White Shiba is a picky customer from the village area. It commonly orders Mushroom Pasta, Kimbap, Shaved Ice, or Scrambled Eggs & Tomatoes. My personal favorite aspect of this customer is the tongue sticking out detail that gives it its particularly cute aura. 

### 4. White-Collar Fox

The White-Color Fox is a dapper, yet impatient customer from the bustling city. Its description directly states that it seems to "do business with some dangerous humans". The fox commonly orders Kebabs, Salmon Sushi, Whiskey, Wrap, Roast Shrimp, or Sweet and Sour Pork. The fashionable briefcase and suit brings together the character design of this customer. 

### 5. Glamarous Lady

Glamarous Lady fashions a leapord print dress with a red scarf and handbag. As a very rare customer, she has a special ability of eating six different dishes and speeds up cooking by 100%. The Glamarous Lady commonly orders Fried Tofu, Sweet Dumplings, Rice Pudding, Pork on Rice, Cold Watermelon, or Sycee Dumplings.

## Top Five Staff:
_There are a total of 15 possible staff members, each fufilling a different purpose in the restaurant._

### 1. Chef Gumi

Chef Gumi! The head chef and the key player of Animal Restaurant. You will depend a lot on him during crazy rush hours. Overtime, you will grow quite fond of Gumi's mysteries and indifference.

### 2. Delivery Boy Tate and Delivery Girl Kat
